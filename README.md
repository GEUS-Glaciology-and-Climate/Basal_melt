# Basal_melt
Python code for plotting figures presented in Karlsson et al., 2021, Nature Comms.

This repository contains python script for plotting the figures 1D, 1E, 1F and 2A presented in the manuscript by Karlsson et al., 2021. 
Associated data files can be downloaded from the GEUS PROMICE dataverse: https://dataverse01.geus.dk/dataverse/PROMICE, DOI: 10.22008/FK2/PLNUEO.

The figures show basal melt in metres per year. The total basal melt from the ice sheet can be found by summing the grid cells, keeping in mind that each grid cell corresponds to a 1km by 1km square. Note that values may differ from those presented in the original manuscript due to re-projection from irregular to regular grid.
